The A* path finding algorithm.

The package contains a sample application which illustrates how the algorithm
finds paths.

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

The landscape for path finding comprises cells with varying colours: the darker
the colour the higher the cost of passing through the cell. The darkest cells
are blocked. The objective for the algorithm is to find the lowest cost path
from the top left to the bottom right of the landscape.

Use the `Randomise`button to change the landscape: then use the`Route` button to
show the path.
